- **GitHub Sponsors**: Direct sponsorship for open-source contributions with zero platform fees.
- **UPI / GPay**: Instant bank-to-bank transfers (optimized for India) with integrated QR codes and identity copying.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Corporate UI/UX**: Clean "Inter" typography with a professional color palette.
- **Dynamic Theme support**: Built-in Dark Mode and Light Mode with system preference detection.
- **Interactive Tabs**: Smooth switching between payment providers without page reloads.
- **Mobile Optimized**: Fully responsive grid layout that adapts to any screen size.
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: One-click copying for UPI IDs to ensure accuracy.
- **Secure by Design**: Verified badges and SSL-focused messaging to build trust.
