Key Projects @Amazon: - 3D Support Coordinator
~ Before I joined the 3D India Team (Operations & Support), managing, analyzing, troubleshooting, and publishing key performance metrics for users/artists/leads/managers involved using multiple tools (Excel, Quip, Data Extracts, Emails, etc.), with significant manual effort. This process resulted in increased latency and decreased accuracy/troubleshooting scope for the final reports.
~ When I joined as the 3D Support Coordinator (MIS) for the 3D India Team on July 6, 2020, these tasks were assigned to me as an immediate goal.
~ I began automating the process and performed detailed analysis and smoke testing to understand and innovate the existing process flow, restructuring the process and reports for optimal efficiency and accuracy.
~ This was achieved using SQL queries, stored procedures, events, Excel advanced formulas, macros, etc.
~ From week 34 of 2020 on-wards, the KPI metrics for the Operations Team went live with automation, saving approximately 6+ manager/lead hours per week. From week 38 of 2020 onwards, the KPI metrics for the Support-QA Team went live with automation, saving approximately 5+ manager/lead hours per week.
~ Automation s were created from scratch, resulting in 30 stored procedures and 20 events, till date, to accommodate various tasks for the 3D India Teams (Operations, Support-QA). Additionally, I developed an automation event/steps log table to track and troubleshoot various failures, pinpointing the exact segment of code that needs to be tweaked/addressed.

latest:

= Automating Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Reporting for 3D India Team (Operation & Support) - 3D Support Coordinator (MIS) =

~ Challenge: Prior to July 2020, the 3D India team (Operations & Support) relied on manual processes and multiple tools (Excel, Quip, Data Extracts, Emails) to track and analyze KPIs for users, artists, leads, and managers. This resulted in high latency, decreased accuracy, and limited troubleshooting capabilities.
~ Solution: Upon joining as a 3D Support Coordinator (MIS) in July 2020, I led the automation of the KPI reporting process. Leveraging SQL queries, stored procedures, events, advanced Excel formulas, and macros, I streamlined the workflow and re-structured reports for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.
~ Impact:
~~ Automated reports went live for the Operations team in Week Y-34 of 2020, saving an estimated 6+ manager/lead hours per week.
~~ Support-QA team reports were automated in Week Y-38 of 2020, further saving 5+ manager/lead hours per week.
~~ Developed custom automation scripts including 30 stored procedures and 20 events to handle various tasks and functionalities for the 3D India teams.
~~ Implemented an event/step log table to facilitate troubleshooting and pinpoint specific code segments requiring adjustments.
