# Transcript Studio for YouTube — Browser Extension

A Chrome/Edge **Manifest V3** side-panel extension that pulls the transcript or
subtitles from any YouTube video or Short. Pick the language, auto-translate,
search, click a line to jump the video, and export as TXT, timestamped TXT,
SRT, VTT, Markdown or JSON.

Everything runs locally in your browser — no servers, no accounts, no tracking.

> Part of [Transcript Studio for YouTube](../README.md) (which also ships a
> [command-line companion](../cli/README.md)). Free — if it helps you,
> [support it 💛](https://krishnakanthb13.github.io/S/).

## 🚀 Install (unpacked) — step by step

> Prefer a gentler, screenshot-style walkthrough? See the
> [top-level guide](../README.md#-how-to-use-the-extension--step-by-step).

**1. Get the files (one time)**
- On GitHub, click **Code → Download ZIP**, then **unzip** it.
- The extension is the folder **`O/YT/extension`**.

**2. Add it to your browser (one time)**
1. Go to `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`).
2. Toggle **Developer mode** (top-right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and choose the **`O/YT/extension`** folder.
4. *(Optional)* Pin the 📝 icon via the puzzle-piece 🧩 menu.

**3. Use it (every time)**
1. Open any YouTube video or Short with captions.
2. Click the 📝 toolbar icon — the side panel opens on the right.
3. Pick a language (optional), then click **Get transcript**.

> Needs Chrome/Edge **114+** (for the side-panel API). Clicking the toolbar icon
> opens the panel directly; there is no popup.

### Updating later

Download the new files over the old folder, then go to `chrome://extensions`
and click the **↻ reload** icon on the Transcript Studio card.

### AI summaries (optional, bring-your-own key)

The ✨ panel can summarize, outline, generate timestamped **auto-chapters**, or
pull out **action items** from the loaded transcript. It uses **your own Google
Gemini API key** ([free key here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)), stored
locally in your browser. Models: **Gemini 3.5 Flash** (default) or **3.1
Flash-Lite**. Nothing is sent anywhere except the direct call from your browser
to Google's Gemini API — and only when you press Generate.

## 🔒 Permissions — and why each is needed

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `sidePanel` | The whole UI lives in the side panel. |
| `scripting` | Reads the player data and fetches captions from inside the YouTube tab. |
| `activeTab` | Acts only on the YouTube tab you're viewing. |
| `storage` | Remembers your preferences and (locally) your optional AI key. |
| `downloads` | Saves the exported transcript / summary file. |
| host: `youtube.com`, `youtu.be` | Limits all of the above to YouTube only. |
| **optional** host: `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | Requested at runtime **only if** you enable AI summaries. |

No analytics, no remote code, no tracking. The only network calls are to
YouTube (for captions) and — if you opt in — directly to Google's Gemini API.

## 🛠 How it works (and why it's reliable)

Two problems sink most DIY YouTube-transcript code:

1. **Wrong JS world.** Reading `ytInitialPlayerResponse` from a content script's
   *isolated world* fails — that page variable doesn't live there. We inject into
   the page's **MAIN world** via `chrome.scripting.executeScript` and read the real
   player object (with an HTML-fetch fallback) to list the caption tracks.
2. **PoToken (since ~June 2025).** The WEB player's caption `baseUrl` now carries
   `&exp=xpe` and returns an **empty body** without a runtime proof-of-origin
   token. So we don't use it. Instead we call YouTube's **InnerTube `player`
   endpoint with a non-web client (ANDROID → IOS → MWEB → WEB)**, whose caption
   URLs are *not* PoToken-gated, and fetch `json3` from there. The format is
   auto-detected (`json3` or XML — `srv1`/`srv3`) and parsed accordingly.

Because `host_permissions` cover YouTube, these run fine from the tab without CORS
issues.

```
panel.js ──executeScript(MAIN world)──▶ youtube.com tab
   1. read player response  → caption track list (UI)
   2. POST youtubei/v1/player {client: ANDROID…}  → un-gated caption baseUrl
   3. GET baseUrl&fmt=json3                        → caption data
         ◀── raw json3 / xml ──
lib/captions.js  parse → segments → clean/paragraph → format (TXT/SRT/VTT/MD/CSV/JSON) + stats
panel.js (optional) ──▶ Gemini API (your key)       → AI summary / chapters
```

## ✅ Develop & test

The caption core is pure (no DOM, no `chrome.*`) so it runs under Node:

```bash
node test/captions.test.js     # 21 tests
```

After editing any file, reload the extension at `chrome://extensions`
(the ↻ icon on the card) and reopen the side panel.

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

- **"Open a YouTube video"** — the active tab isn't a YouTube page; switch tabs and reopen the panel.
- **"No captions on this video"** — the video genuinely has no subtitles/transcript.
- **"Could not fetch transcript"** — YouTube occasionally rate-limits; reload the video tab and retry.
- **Nothing happens on icon click** — confirm Chrome/Edge is 114+; on older builds the side-panel API is unavailable.
