				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>~ Before I joined the 3D India Team (Operations & Support), managing, analyzing, troubleshooting, and publishing key performance metrics for users/artists/leads/managers involved using multiple tools (Excel, Quip, Data Extracts, Emails, etc.), with significant manual effort. This process resulted in increased latency and decreased accuracy/troubleshooting scope for the final reports.</li>
					<li>~ When I joined as the 3D Support Coordinator (MIS) for the 3D India Team on July 6, 2020, these tasks were assigned to me as an immediate goal.</li>
					<li>~ I began automating the process and performed detailed analysis and smoke testing to understand and innovate the existing process flow, restructuring the process and reports for optimal efficiency and accuracy.</li>
					<li>~ This was achieved using SQL queries, stored procedures, events, Excel advanced formulas, macros, etc.</li>
					<li>~ From week 34 of 2020 on-wards, the KPI metrics for the Operations Team went live with automation, saving approximately 6+ manager/lead hours per week. From week 38 of 2020 onwards, the KPI metrics for the Support-QA Team went live with automation, saving approximately 5+ manager/lead hours per week.</li>
					<li>~ Automation s were created from scratch, resulting in 30 stored procedures and 20 events, till date, to accommodate various tasks for the 3D India Teams (Operations, Support-QA). Additionally, I developed an automation event/steps log table to track and troubleshoot various failures, pinpointing the exact segment of code that needs to be tweaked/addressed.</li>
